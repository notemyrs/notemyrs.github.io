  <section>
    <h1>📚 Blog</h1>
    <p>These are not just blogs. They are windows.  
    Into thought, into truth, into everything I’ve seen, survived, and chosen to share.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- BLOG POSTS LIST -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2><a href="why-this-website.html">🌐 Why This Website</a></h2>
    <p>A space built not to show off, but to show others what’s possible. A digital home where silence ends and stories begin.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2><a href="why-change.html">🔁 Why Change</a></h2>
    <p>Change is not a gift. It’s a memory waiting to be recovered. A truth that someone, somewhere, once believed they were not meant to forget.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2><a href="how-i-fell-in-love-with-astronomy.html">🌌 How I Fell in Love with Astronomy</a></h2>
    <p>Not in a lab, but under a sky that didn’t speak — yet still told me everything. A story of stars, wonder, and why I still look up.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2><a href="what-physics-taught-me.html">📘 What Physics Taught Me</a></h2>
    <p>In every law, I found a lesson. In every equation, a mirror. Physics didn’t just describe the world — it helped me understand myself.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2><a href="what-i-want-to-build-with-ai.html">🤖 What I Want to Build with AI</a></h2>
    <p>I don’t want to automate life. I want to restore it. I want AI that listens before it predicts, and remembers before it answers.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2><a href="what-i-want-my-life-to-mean.html">✨ What I Want My Life to Mean</a></h2>
    <p>Not a name on a certificate. A presence in someone’s memory. This is my truth — to be someone who makes others believe again.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2><a href="what-i-found-in-failure.html">💔 What I Found in Failure</a></h2>
    <p>I thought failure would end me. It didn’t. It began me. This post is about the silence after the fall — and the strength that stood up inside it.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2><a href="becoming-without-permission.html">🔥 Becoming Without Permission</a></h2>
    <p>I wasn’t invited. I entered anyway. This is the path of those who rise not because they’re ready — but because they’re tired of waiting.</p>
