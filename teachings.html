  <!-- TEACHINGS -->
  <section>
    <h1>🧠 Life Teachings</h1>
    <p>These teachings weren’t learned from textbooks. They came from silence. From setbacks. From becoming.  
    They are not rules — they’re reminders.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>1. You’re allowed to begin again — even in the middle</h2>
    <p>Some chapters don’t end with closure. They just… shift.  
    And you don’t need to wait for permission to start again.  
    You can start in the quiet. In the confusion. In the middle of the storm — and still make it beautiful.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>2. Growth is not always visible — but it’s always valuable</h2>
    <p>Just because they can’t see it doesn’t mean it’s not happening.  
    Healing takes time. Becoming takes silence.  
    Some progress lives in your heart long before the world claps for it.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>3. You don’t have to win to be worthy</h2>
    <p>Your value was never tied to results.  
    Not your rank. Not your title. Not your outcome.  
    You are enough — even in the middle of your mess.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>4. Fear is a gate, not a wall</h2>
    <p>Every time I faced fear and walked through it, something beautiful was waiting.  
    It never disappears. But it becomes familiar.  
    And then you realize — courage isn’t loud. It’s consistent.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>5. Not all impact is visible — but it’s deeply real</h2>
    <p>You may never know who you inspired. Who kept going because you didn’t quit.  
    But trust this — your kindness created ripples you’ll never see. And they matter.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>6. Becoming is painful, quiet, and beautiful</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, you’ll break quietly.  
    Sometimes, you’ll grow in silence.  
    But one day you’ll realize — those moments made you.  
    They shaped the strongest, softest version of you.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>These are the truths I carry.  
    And if even one of them stays with you — then they were never just mine.</p>
