    <h1>🤖 What I Want to Build with AI</h1>

    <p>They ask me, “What do you want to build with AI?”  
    And I never say faster tools. Or smarter machines.  
    Because what I want to build —  
    is something that remembers we are human first.</p>

    <p>I want to build systems that don’t just solve — they understand.  
    Interfaces that don’t just respond — they listen.  
    Tools that don’t replace human hands — but help tired ones rise again.</p>

    <blockquote>“I don’t want AI that sounds human.  
    I want AI that reminds us how to be.”</blockquote>

    <h2>🌍 Where This Dream Was Born</h2>

    <p>This didn’t begin in a lab.  
    It began in classrooms where students sat quietly — not because they didn’t have thoughts,  
    but because no one asked them to speak.</p>

    <p>It began in villages where children dreamt with nothing in their hands — but stars in their eyes.  
    In homes where silence taught more than schoolbooks ever could.  
    In broken systems where even the kindest people had to shout just to be heard.</p>

    <p>That’s where the dream began:  
    Not to build intelligence — but to restore dignity.</p>

    <h2>🧠 What I Want to Build</h2>

    <p>I want to build AI that carries care in its code.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>🌱 A tutor for a child in a rural town — patient, encouraging, in their language.</li>
      <li>🧑‍🏫 A companion for teachers — saving them time so they can give students attention.</li>
      <li>🫂 A listener for those who feel unheard — not to diagnose, but to sit beside them in silence.</li>
      <li>🌍 A bridge — between those with knowledge, and those with need.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I don’t want AI that impresses.  
    I want AI that heals.  
    That remembers the people who were forgotten when technology rushed ahead.</p>

    <blockquote>“The future I want to build is not smart. It’s soulful.”</blockquote>

    <h2>🛠 Technology With Soul</h2>

    <p>We say “artificial intelligence,”  
    but what if the most powerful thing it could do  
    was make us more aware of our real intelligence —  
    our compassion, our curiosity, our connection?</p>

    <p>What if the machines we built became mirrors —  
    reflecting back not just data,  
    but what we value, what we ignore,  
    what we choose to protect?</p>

    <p>I want AI that helps people believe in themselves again.  
    That doesn’t just run on code,  
    but on conscience.</p>

    <h2>💬 What This Means to Me</h2>

    <p>To me, building AI isn’t about innovation.  
    It’s about redemption.  
    Giving voice to the voiceless. Time to the overworked.  
    Grace to those who have only known grind.</p>

    <p>Because I’ve been that student who needed more.  
    I’ve seen teachers who deserved better.  
    I’ve sat with young minds who gave up — not because they couldn’t,  
    but because no one believed they could.</p>

    <p>And I want to build for them.  
    With them.  
    As one of them.</p>

    <blockquote>“I don’t build machines. I build belief.”</blockquote>

    <h2>✨ What I Hope</h2>

    <p>I hope that one day, when someone asks what I built,  
    they don’t say “an app” or “a model.”  
    I hope they say:  
    <em>“He built something that helped people feel seen again.”</em></p>

    <p>And if I can do that —  
    even once,  
    even quietly —  
    then this whole journey will have been worth it.</p>
