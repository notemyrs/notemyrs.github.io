    <h1>🔁 Why Change</h1>

    <p>Change is not a revolution we wait for.  
    It’s a decision we make — quietly, consistently, and often alone.</p>

    <p>I’ve seen places where people whisper their dreams —  
    not because they don’t believe in them,  
    but because the world never gave them permission to speak them out loud.</p>

    <p>I’ve met students who were brilliant — but only in silence.  
    Not because they lacked intelligence,  
    but because no one ever looked them in the eye and said,  
    <em>“You’re allowed to want more.”</em></p>

    <blockquote>“Change doesn’t start when the world agrees.  
    It starts when someone refuses to stay the same.”</blockquote>

    <h2>🧠 The Real Problem</h2>

    <p>It’s not always hunger or poverty that holds people back.  
    Sometimes, it’s the belief that they are meant to stay behind.  
    That they are born to obey, to survive, to accept.  
    And that belief is the most dangerous thing ever given to a child.</p>

    <p>We’ve created systems that teach people how to pass — not how to question.  
    How to compete — not how to collaborate.  
    How to memorize — not how to imagine.</p>

    <p>And in the process, we’ve made people forget they were born with power.  
    Not because they’re different — but because they’re human.</p>

    <h2>🔥 What I’ve Seen</h2>

    <p>I’ve seen girls being told they can’t.  
    Boys being taught that strength means silence.  
    Teachers being forced to deliver syllabus instead of spark.  
    And entire communities believing they are meant to survive — not thrive.</p>

    <p>I’ve seen people fold their dreams so small,  
    they could hide them behind polite smiles.  
    And I’ve seen how dangerous that is —  
    because once someone forgets their voice, it takes a lifetime to get it back.</p>

    <blockquote>“Real change doesn’t ask, ‘Is it allowed?’  
    It says, ‘It’s already too late not to.’”</blockquote>

    <h2>🌍 Why We Need Change</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Because education should feel like curiosity, not pressure.</li>
      <li>Because silence is not peace — it’s often pain with no voice.</li>
      <li>Because no child should grow up believing they are less.</li>
      <li>Because communities don't need saving. They need awakening.</li>
      <li>Because the world doesn’t need more perfect people — it needs more courageous ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 What Change Actually Is</h2>

    <p>Change is not always big.  
    Sometimes it’s a conversation that makes someone feel seen.  
    A teacher who says, “I believe in you.”  
    A student who decides to ask “why?” for the first time.  
    A girl who chooses to say “no.”  
    A boy who learns that kindness is power too.</p>

    <p>Change is a mother learning how to read at 40.  
    A village student learning Python.  
    A young voice speaking truth in front of silence.</p>

    <blockquote>“Change is not something we gift.  
    It’s something we uncover.  
    It was always there — buried under fear.”</blockquote>

    <h2>👣 Why I Won’t Wait</h2>

    <p>I’m not here to wait for change.  
    I’m here to become it — even if no one notices.  
    Even if it’s slow. Even if it’s hard.  
    Because every time someone decides they’ve had enough —  
    the world shifts, even a little.</p>

    <p>I want to be that shift.  
    I want my life to be proof that  
    you don’t need to be rich, famous, or loud to matter.  
    You just need to begin — and never stop becoming.</p>

    <p><em>This is my voice.  
    This is my answer.  
    This is why I choose change —  
    because someone has to. And I’d rather it be me.</em></p>
