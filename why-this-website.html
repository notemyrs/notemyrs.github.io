    <h1>🌐 Why This Website</h1>

    <p>This is not a project. This is a piece of me.  
    A place that holds every question I asked in silence. Every truth I was afraid to speak.  
    Every reason I stayed up one more night, kept going one more step, even when I didn’t know where I was heading.</p>

    <p>I didn’t build this to display what I’ve done.  
    I built this to remind someone out there that they are not alone.</p>

    <blockquote>“This isn’t a portfolio. It’s a voice I wish someone had given me when I needed it most.”</blockquote>

    <h2>🛠 Forged From More Than Code</h2>

    <p>This website was made in the spaces between the big moments —  
    In the quiet mornings after failure.  
    In the silent victories no one clapped for.  
    In the pages of books that made me question everything.  
    In the laughter of students I taught, who unknowingly taught me even more.</p>

    <p>I didn’t write this in perfect confidence.  
    I wrote it in uncertainty — and that’s exactly why it’s real.</p>

    <h2>🌌 A Place to Hold Wonder</h2>

    <p>This is where my love for astronomy lives — not as data, but as awe.  
    Where I remember lying under the stars, asking questions no one could answer.  
    And instead of waiting, I decided to find my own.</p>

    <p>Here, physics becomes poetry.  
    AI becomes empathy.  
    And learning becomes something we feel, not just memorize.</p>

    <h2>🔥 A Reminder of Becoming</h2>

    <p>I’ve been a fighter. A teacher. A listener. A leader.  
    I’ve stood with gold around my neck — and tears in my eyes when no one saw.  
    I’ve failed and learned.  
    I’ve spoken and been unheard.  
    But every time I got back up — it meant something.</p>

    <p>This website is that proof —  
    Not that I’ve reached the top.  
    But that I kept climbing when I had every reason not to.</p>

    <blockquote>“We don’t inspire by being perfect.  
    We inspire by being honest about the climb.”</blockquote>

    <h2>💬 Why I Want You Here</h2>

    <p>I want this space to breathe with you.  
    I want you to see something here and feel a part of you echo back.  
    I want you to walk away not saying, “Wow, he’s done a lot,”  
    but whispering, “Maybe I can start too.”</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever felt behind — this is for you.  
    If you’ve ever been told to shrink — this is for you.  
    If you’ve ever doubted your light — this is for you.</p>

    <p>This is a home for the unheard.  
    The quiet leaders.  
    The fighters in silence.  
    The curious minds who don’t want to impress — they want to *impact*.</p>

    <h2>🌱 The Future I Dream Of</h2>

    <p>One where education awakens, not suppresses.  
    Where AI serves people — not replaces them.  
    Where silence isn’t seen as weakness.  
    Where stories like mine — and yours — aren’t rare. They’re seen.</p>

    <p><em>This website is the beginning of that dream.  
    A mirror of my journey. A map for someone else’s.  
    And a reminder that you don’t need to be loud to be heard.  
    You just need to be real.</em></p>
