    <h1>🥋 What Sports Taught Me</h1>
    <p>I’ve stood on podiums. I’ve stood in silence. But I’ve never stopped showing up.  
    Sports — especially <strong>Sillambam</strong> — didn’t just train my body.  
    It shaped my spirit.</p>

    <blockquote>“You don’t win because you’re fearless. You win because you show up, even when afraid.”</blockquote>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>💥 When You Win</h2>
    <p>You feel invincible.  
    The world claps. You smile. But the real lesson is not in the cheers — it's in the calm that comes after.  
    Victory taught me gratitude. And that being on top is temporary — but how you carry it, defines you forever.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>💔 When You Lose</h2>
    <p>I’ve given everything — my time, my energy, my belief — and still lost.  
    There’s no crowd for that. Just silence.  
    But in that silence, I found reflection.  
    I learned how to heal. How to hold pain gently. How to try again.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>🧠 What Discipline Feels Like</h2>
    <p>Waking up when it’s dark. Training when you don’t feel like it.  
    Doing one more round even when no one’s watching.  
    That’s what makes athletes different.  
    Not strength — <strong>repetition</strong>.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>🦁 What Fear Taught Me</h2>
    <p>I used to fear falling.  
    Now, I respect it. Because every fall brought me closer to strength.  
    Fear isn’t the enemy. It’s the threshold.  
    And when you cross it, you meet a version of yourself you didn’t know existed.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>🔥 What Sports Made Me</h2>
    <p>A fighter — not in tournaments, but in life.  
    A leader — not by shouting, but by standing tall.  
    A believer — not in luck, but in effort.</p>

    <p><em>And above all, a student — of loss, resilience, and silent victories that no medal can ever measure.</em></p>
