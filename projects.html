  <!-- PROJECTS -->
  <section>
    <h1>🛠 My Projects</h1>
    <p>These are not just builds — they’re beliefs turned into code. Each one begins with a deeper question:  
    <em>Can I make something that doesn’t just work… but matters?</em></p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>🤖 AI Veritas — <em>Coming Soon</em></h2>
    <p>Veritas means truth. This project explores how we can build artificial intelligence that is not only powerful — but purposeful.  
    It’s about combining logic with ethics, algorithms with empathy.  
    Imagine a chatbot that doesn’t just answer — it understands.  
    A system that supports students, empowers teachers, and listens deeply.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>🌍 Tribes for Good — <em>Coming Soon</em></h2>
    <p>This is where technology meets social impact.  
    Through this initiative, I’m exploring how digital tools can uplift communities who are often overlooked — by making AI accessible, useful, and human-centered.  
    From mental health to education, the goal is to co-create change that lasts.</p>

  <section class="project">
    <h2>📱 Astronomy EdTech Prototype — <em>Research Phase</em></h2>
    <p>Born from teaching underprivileged kids about the solar system, this prototype aims to make astronomy simple, visual, and magical — even without a telescope.  
    A tool that turns curiosity into connection. Coming soon as part of my EdTech passion project.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>💡 What Drives My Work</h2>
    <p>It’s not just about solving problems. It’s about solving <strong>the right</strong> ones.  
    I build because I believe people deserve tools that serve them.  
    And if my code can bring clarity, comfort, or courage to even one person — then it’s done more than enough.</p>
