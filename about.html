  <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
  <section>
    <h1>🌟 About Me</h1>

    <p>I’m Yash Adkar. But this isn’t just a name. It’s a journey. A story still being written — one built on questions, quiet courage, and the desire to make learning something people feel, not fear.</p>

    <p>I was never the loudest in the room. But I was always the one asking, “Why?”  
    Why are stars burning in silence? Why do some kids never get to dream? Why do we measure intelligence instead of nurturing it?</p>

    <blockquote>“The world doesn’t need more perfect people. It needs more honest ones.”</blockquote>

    <h2>🚀 Where It All Began</h2>
    <p>It began with astronomy. Lying on rooftops, trying to read the sky like it was a letter written just for me. I didn’t just fall in love with stars — I found myself in them.  
    That wonder took me to ISRO, and to classrooms where I taught kids who’d never seen the solar system, only heard of it.</p>

    <h2>🧠 My Fascination with Physics</h2>
    <p>Then came physics. Not as equations, but as metaphors. Newton’s laws weren’t just science — they were life.  
    Inertia: how we stay stuck until something breaks us open.  
    Momentum: how belief builds with every step.  
    Force: how even a whisper of hope can move a mountain.</p>

    <h2>🤖 Why AI?</h2>
    <p>Because it’s the future. But more importantly — because it’s still human.  
    I work with AI not to automate, but to amplify.  
    I dream of building tools that don’t just think faster — they think deeper. Tools that serve, that understand, that empower.</p>

    <h2>⚔️ Struggle, Silence, Strength</h2>
    <p>Yes, I’ve won national medals. But I’ve also sat with loss, deeply.  
    I’ve seen people who believe they’re born to stay behind. I’ve taught those who never felt seen.  
    And it broke something in me — in the best way.  
    I stopped chasing perfection.  
    I started chasing impact.</p>

    <blockquote>“You don’t need to be the loudest. You need to be the one who cares the most.”</blockquote>

    <h2>💬 Why This Website Exists</h2>
    <p>I built this to give others what I once searched for —  
    a story, a spark, a signal that they too are meant for more.</p>

    <p>This is not a resume. It’s a reminder — that you can start from silence and still be heard.  
    That curiosity is not a weakness. It’s the beginning of brilliance.</p>

    <p>And if even one person visits this site and thinks,  
    <strong>“Maybe I’m not too late. Maybe I can begin too.”</strong>  
    Then this space will have done what it came to do.</p>
