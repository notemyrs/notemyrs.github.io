    <h1>🌌 How I Fell in Love with Astronomy</h1>

    <p>I didn’t fall in love with astronomy in a lab.  
    I fell in love with it on a rooftop —  
    eyes wide open, heart even wider,  
    staring into a sky that didn’t blink back, but somehow understood me.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t silence I heard up there.  
    It was storytelling — written in stars.  
    Not loud. But ancient. Soft. Still.  
    Like the universe was whispering,  
    <em>“You belong here too.”</em></p>

    <blockquote>“The sky didn’t teach me facts.  
    It taught me wonder. And that changed everything.”</blockquote>

    <h2>🌠 The First Question</h2>

    <p>I remember being a child — asking what stars were made of.  
    But what I really meant was —  
    <em>“Why do I feel something in my chest when I look at them?”</em></p>

    <p>Everyone gave scientific answers.  
    Hydrogen. Light-years. Nuclear fusion.  
    But no one explained the ache. The pull.  
    The way a sky could look like a map to something I hadn’t become yet.</p>

    <p>That was the beginning.  
    Not of knowledge — but of wonder.</p>

    <h2>🔭 Wonder That Wanted to Know</h2>

    <p>Over time, that wonder grew teeth. It wanted to learn.  
    I started reading. Watching. Asking more questions.  
    I joined astronomy groups. I visited ISRO.  
    And suddenly — it wasn’t just emotion. It was direction.</p>

    <p>But even now — with all I’ve studied —  
    I still look up and feel the same stillness.  
    The same sacred silence that says,  
    “You don’t need to know everything to belong here.”</p>

    <blockquote>“Astronomy isn’t just about what’s out there.  
    It’s about what awakens in us when we look up.”</blockquote>

    <h2>🧠 How It Changed Me</h2>

    <p>Astronomy made me small — but not weak.  
    Small in a beautiful way. Like I was part of something huge.  
    Like I didn’t need to carry the world, I just needed to marvel at it.</p>

    <p>It taught me that distance doesn’t mean disconnection.  
    That even stars long gone can still light our skies.  
    And maybe people are like that too.  
    Maybe we leave light behind in the lives we touch —  
    even after we’re gone.</p>

    <h2>🌌 Why I Still Look Up</h2>

    <p>Because the sky is honest.  
    It doesn’t ask you for anything.  
    It just invites you to feel — curious, small, alive.</p>

    <p>I want to bring that feeling to places where the stars feel too far.  
    I want to teach astronomy not as science — but as story.  
    A reminder to every child that there’s more beyond their rooftop.  
    That they are made of the same things stars are —  
    and they too, are allowed to shine.</p>

    <blockquote>“I don’t just study the sky.  
    I listen to it.  
    And every night, it teaches me how to dream again.”</blockquote>

    <p><em>That’s how I fell in love with astronomy.  
    Not through a telescope. But through longing.  
    Through silence. Through the feeling that maybe —  
    the universe had written me into its sky too.</em></p>
